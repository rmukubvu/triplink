# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The real-time tracking feature enables continuous monitoring and status updates for trips and loads throughout the transportation journey. This system provides visibility to both carriers and shippers, allowing them to track cargo location, delivery progress, and receive automated notifications about important events during transit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a shipper, I want to track my cargo in real-time, so that I can monitor delivery progress and provide accurate updates to my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a trip status changes THEN the system SHALL update all associated load tracking records
3. WHEN a tracking update occurs THEN the system SHALL notify relevant stakeholders via their preferred notification method
4. WHEN a shipper requests tracking information THEN the system SHALL provide current location, status, and estimated delivery time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a carrier, I want to update trip status and location, so that shippers can see real-time progress of their cargo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a carrier updates trip location THEN the system SHALL record GPS coordinates with timestamp
2. WHEN a carrier changes trip status THEN the system SHALL validate the status transition is allowed
3. WHEN location updates are received THEN the system SHALL calculate estimated arrival times based on current position and route
4. IF a trip is delayed beyond threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically notify affected shippers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor tracking data quality and system performance, so that I can ensure reliable service delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and completeness
2. WHEN tracking updates fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators via monitoring dashboard
4. WHEN tracking history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trail of all status changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a shipper or carrier, I want to receive automated notifications about important tracking events, so that I can respond promptly to issues or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trip departs THEN the system SHALL notify shipper with departure confirmation and tracking link
2. WHEN a delivery is completed THEN the system SHALL notify both carrier and shipper with completion confirmation
3. WHEN significant delays occur THEN the system SHALL send alert notifications to affected parties
4. WHEN cargo arrives at destination THEN the system SHALL trigger delivery notification workflow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user (carrier or shipper), I want to access tracking information on my mobile device, so that I can stay informed while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing tracking via mobile THEN the system SHALL provide responsive interface optimized for mobile devices
2. WHEN offline connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any pending location updates
3. WHEN push notifications are enabled THEN the system SHALL send real-time alerts to mobile devices
4. WHEN GPS tracking is active THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage battery usage and data consumption
