# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TripLink Mobile App is a cross-platform mobile application built with Expo/React Native that provides carriers and shippers with real-time tracking, shipment management, and communication capabilities on the go. The app integrates with the existing TripLink backend to provide a seamless mobile experience for logistics management, with a focus on real-time tracking, notifications, and offline capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my existing TripLink account, so that I can access my data securely on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a login screen
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the TripLink backend and store a secure token
3. WHEN a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN a user chooses to log out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data and return to the login screen
5. WHEN a user enables biometric authentication THEN the system SHALL allow login using fingerprint or face recognition on subsequent app launches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a carrier, I want to view and manage my trips on my mobile device, so that I can stay informed and make updates while on the road.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a carrier logs in THEN the system SHALL display a list of active and upcoming trips
2. WHEN a carrier selects a trip THEN the system SHALL display detailed trip information including route, loads, and status
3. WHEN a carrier updates trip status THEN the system SHALL sync the change with the backend and notify relevant shippers
4. WHEN a carrier receives a new trip request THEN the system SHALL display a notification
5. WHEN a carrier views trip details THEN the system SHALL display all associated loads and their information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a shipper, I want to track my shipments in real-time, so that I can monitor delivery progress and provide accurate updates to my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shipper logs in THEN the system SHALL display a list of active shipments
2. WHEN a shipper selects a shipment THEN the system SHALL display real-time tracking information including current location and ETA
3. WHEN a shipment status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display and notify the shipper
4. WHEN a shipper views a shipment THEN the system SHALL display the complete tracking history
5. WHEN a shipper has multiple active shipments THEN the system SHALL provide a summary view of all shipments' statuses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a carrier, I want to update my location and trip status automatically, so that shippers can see real-time progress without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running in the foreground THEN the system SHALL periodically update the carrier's location to the backend
2. WHEN the app is running in the background THEN the system SHALL continue to send location updates at a battery-efficient interval
3. WHEN the carrier crosses predefined milestones THEN the system SHALL automatically update trip status
4. WHEN location services are disabled THEN the system SHALL prompt the carrier to enable them
5. WHEN the carrier manually pauses tracking THEN the system SHALL stop sending location updates until tracking is resumed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive push notifications for important events, so that I can stay informed even when not actively using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trip status changes THEN the system SHALL send a push notification to relevant users
2. WHEN a new message is received THEN the system SHALL display a push notification with the sender and preview
3. WHEN a delay is detected THEN the system SHALL send a push notification to affected users
4. WHEN a user taps on a notification THEN the system SHALL open the app to the relevant screen
5. WHEN a user configures notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those settings for future notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the app offline, so that I can access critical information and queue updates when connectivity is limited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loses internet connectivity THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached data
2. WHEN a user makes changes while offline THEN the system SHALL queue those changes for synchronization
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued changes with the backend
4. WHEN operating offline THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the offline status to the user
5. WHEN in offline mode THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical functionality that doesn't require real-time data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to communicate with other parties involved in my shipments, so that I can coordinate activities and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a trip or load THEN the system SHALL display a messaging option
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all relevant parties
3. WHEN a user receives a message THEN the system SHALL display a notification
4. WHEN a user views a conversation THEN the system SHALL display the complete message history
5. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue outgoing messages for delivery when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be optimized for mobile use, so that I can efficiently perform tasks with minimal battery and data consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is tracking location THEN the system SHALL use battery-efficient methods
2. WHEN transferring data THEN the system SHALL compress and optimize payloads to minimize data usage
3. WHEN displaying maps and routes THEN the system SHALL use efficient rendering techniques
4. WHEN the device is low on battery THEN the system SHALL reduce tracking frequency
5. WHEN the user enables data saving mode THEN the system SHALL minimize background data usage
